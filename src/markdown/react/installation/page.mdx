## React Installation

First of all install <a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation">tailwind</a> and these packages:

<Installation />

Now choose any component you find useful, copy it to your project, and adjust it
so it fulfills your needs.

<br />

### Reusability and accessibility

Keep in mind that these are YOUR components. It's on you to make them more reusable
and accessible. I created this to help you get started with neobrutalism.{' '}

<br />

If reusability and accessibility are one of your main concerns, I suggest you rather to use <Link href='/shadcn/installation'>shadcn</Link> components even tho these react components are somewhat accessible and reusable.

<br />

### Styling

Don't forget to copy the <Link href='/docs/styling'>desired styling</Link> to your tailwind config.

<Pagination
  next={{
    name: 'Accordion',
    path: '/react/components/Accordion',
  }}
/>

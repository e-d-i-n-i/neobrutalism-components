## Shadcn Installation

Visit <a href='https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation' target='_blank'>shadcn installation page</a> to see how to install shadcn.

<br />

In this docs below each shadcn component's name you'll have the shadcn docs link for that component.

<br />

e.g. You want to install shadcn button component. You'll navigate to <a target='_blank' href='/shadcn/components/button'>button page</a>, click on the shadcn docs
link and install the button component like it's shown in the docs.

<br />

After you're done you'll come back to neobrutalism button page, and copy button component to your project inside `components/ui/button.tsx`
(this is the default component path) or your custom component path.

<br />

Keep in mind that neobrutalism components can have different variants than default shadcn components.

<br />

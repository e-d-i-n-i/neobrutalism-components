## Introduction

Neobrutalism components is a collection of neobrutalism-styled Tailwind components.

<br />
Neobrutalism is a mix of regular brutalism in web design and more modern typography,
illustration, and animation standards. Neobrutalism refuses the usual components
of UX-UI design and embraces uncomfortable design elements, and it is more fearless
to use distinctive color palettes.

<br />I created this collection of components for people who want to learn more
about neobrutalism style and to help them get started with creating neobrutalism
layouts.
